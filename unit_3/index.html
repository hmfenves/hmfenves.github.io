<p>Hello!  My name is Hannah.  Here is a little bit about me and what I do.</p>

<p>I am a graphic designer and illustrator based in Austin, Texas.   I specialize in content layout, branding, and typography.   All of my work starts with a pencil and sketchbook  which ensures my full understanding of interacting elements to create an intentional and personal finished piece.  My design and illustration style differ slightly as I enjoy creating literal and clean layouts, while adding illustrated components when applicable.</p>

<p>Outside my studio, I can be found exploring Austin's plethora of coffee shops, hanging out at the lake, and teaching my Australian Cattle Dog, Scout, how to swim.</p> 

<p>Say hello! Email me at <a href="mailto:hmfenves@me.com">hmfenves@me.com</a></p>
